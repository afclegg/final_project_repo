# Predicting SBA COVID-19 Loans Using Machine Learning
## Ryan Collins & Alex Clegg
###### PPol 670 Final Project May 2020

This project develops machine learning techniques to predict the size of Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster
loans related to the COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

The model predicts SBA disaster loan size based upon historical disaster declaration loan data as well as county and 
zip code level census data. By combing census data such as employer payroll, employee number, sales and receipts, 
industry type, along with otherdemographic data (income levels, racial breakdown, education levels, number of businesses, 
etc.) we developed a multi-variate model that predicts the loan size administered by SBA during disaster scenarios. 
With this model, we then tested the model on future out-of-sample data as SBA released additional information on the program. 
We also began to articulate how this could be used to further calculate aggregate sums, which could prove
useful for policy makers as they estimate total cost of programs such as PPP, which as weâ€™ve seen in recent
days, have had significantly more demand than thought.
